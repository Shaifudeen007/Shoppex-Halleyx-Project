# Shoppex 

Shoppex is a full-stack e-commerce platform built with React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.  
It includes dual-role login (Admin & Customer), product/order management, and customer impersonation.  
Through this project, I enhanced my full-stack skills, API handling, and secure authentication practices.  
Built entirely with my own ideas and effort, it showcases my passion and dedication to development.  
Thanks to the Halleyx company for this opportunity â€” I hope my project impresses you well.
